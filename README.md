### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jesse.
#### I am Principal Systems Engineer for ~~Intel~~ Cloudflare.

I've spent most of my career working on networking and Ethernet. I love working on Open Source projects like Linux because you can see / fix / change the code and you're never beholden to some DDK or binary interface that you have to reverse engineer or call "support" every time something goes wrong.

Skills: Linux / C / C++ / PERF / BASH / PERL / SYSADMIN / PERFORMANCE / PLATFORMS

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m still working on this page.
